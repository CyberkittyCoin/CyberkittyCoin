This section will cover Reflections, the Burn, and Liquidity Pool (LP) injections. That are built in to the CyberKitty Protocol.

When a transaction occurs (Sell, Buy, or Transfer/Exchange) there is a 10% fee to the holder that started the transaction. 
5% of this fee is  is distributed to all holders in reflections. The other 5% is used for Liquidity.

Reflections: Lets start with reflections. Reflections are tokens that are distributed to all wallets that hold SafeMoon. 
As stated earlier, 5% of the 10% fee gets used for reflections. The amount of reflections a holder gets depends on how much the holder has. 
So if a holder has 2% of the total coin supply, that holder receives .02 times the amount of reflections distributed.

*Holder has .02 x 1,000,000,000,000,000 *Holder has 20,000,000,000,000 tokens

x=Distributed Reflections Total y=Earned Reflections (result)

.02 * x = y



Burn: The burn wallet is itself a holder. It's the largest holder of around 42% of the total supply of SafeMoon at the time of this post; 
therefore, it sees the highest reward of the reflections (which ends up being close to 2.1% of the 5% from the date of this post). 
This is where the burn occurs. As reflections are distributed, the burn wallet recieves its portion of reflections which is based on the percentage of 
the total supply that it owns, as stated in the formula above.


Liquidity: The other 5% is used for LP. The Liquidity Contract-Bound Wallet (CBW):
takes the remaining 5% from each transaction. As transactions are made, the amount of safemoon in the liquidity pool (CBW) amasses a specified amount (500 billion),
and to prevent it from getting too large, is split for LP acquisition.

2.5% (250,000,000,000 SafeMoon) of the LP goes to "PancakeSwap: SAFEMOON".

Note: We'll refer to this wallet as "PCL-S" in this overview. This is the SafeMoon liquidity wallet for Safemoon and BNB Liquidity.

The liquidity from PCL-S goes to what is known as the Router wallet. The Router converts the 250 billion safemoon liquidity to BNB and routes 
it back to PCL-S as BNB leaving ~2900 BNB (which should equal 250 billion safemoon) in the wallet for Liquidity. Lastly, 
the remaining 250,000,000,000 SafeMoon liquidity in the CBW is sent to PCL-S thereby completed the injection.
